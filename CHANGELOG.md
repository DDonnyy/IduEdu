<!-- version list -->

## v2.3.0 (2026-10-22)

### Features

- Local PBF source, joint distance and path routing, and average-day GTFS waits
  ([#24](https://github.com/IDUclub/IduEdu/pull/24),
  [`2c22d76`](https://github.com/IDUclub/IduEdu/commit/2c22d765bc0fd580121c7a091a96be881d076307))

* test: regroup unit tests by behavior and run real Numba kernels outside coverage

Tests follow the package layout: graph data, adjacency and UrbanGraph methods live in
  test_urban_graph_unit.py, NetworkX adapters in test_nx_utils_unit.py, and the former
  test_graph_builders_unit.py is split into drive/walk, public-transport and intermodal builder
  modules.

An early pytest plugin in tests/__init__.py preloads NumPy, SciPy, GeoPandas and Numba before
  pytest-cov starts tracing, which avoids the double-load crash on Windows; only coverage runs
  disable JIT, so ordinary runs execute the compiled kernels.

The Numba cache is keyed by interpreter and Numba version instead of a per-process directory, so it
  survives between runs. Small synthetic graphs run on two Numba threads unless NUMBA_NUM_THREADS is
  set.

Branch coverage is enabled in the pytest options so subprocess tests are measured the same way.

* fix(overpass): read subway stop-area members with the route query

The subway query now returns every member of the stop areas after a `make section` marker, so
  entrances, exits and platforms get their roles and coordinates from the same response. Only
  members missing from it are fetched with a second request, and responses cached before the marker
  existed are handled as before.

Subway nodes and edges built from stop areas are merged on keys compared as Python objects. When one
  side held only synthetic string ids, pandas inferred a string dtype and refused to merge it with
  the integer OSM ids (seen on Turin's subway).

Overpass /status is no longer probed before every request: the slot wait is asked for only after a
  429 response, so an ordinary request is a single HTTP call.

The Overpass cache tests move into test_overpass_downloaders_unit.py.

* feat(transport): grow free speed with segment length and refit the default registry

TransportSpec gains optional long_speed_kmh and speed_half_length_m. When they are set, the free
  speed grows with the segment length L from base_speed_kmh towards long_speed_kmh and is halfway
  there at L = speed_half_length_m. free_speed_kmh(L) exposes it and travel_time_min uses it; both
  fields default to None, which keeps one free speed for every segment.

The default registry is refitted on every published GTFS segment that has its own shape geometry
  (about 859,000 segments in 239 cities), every city weighing the same and cross-validated on
  held-out cities. Tram and train use the growing free speed; bus, trolleybus and subway keep one.
  Waiting times are medians across cities of the average-day timetable wait over regular daytime
  services. Monorail and share taxi still borrow the subway and bus profiles.

The transport registry guide and notebook show the new parameters and defaults.

* feat(graph): compute distances and paths together in one Dijkstra search

single_source_dijkstra, multi_source_dijkstra (nearest source) and dijkstra_parallel (independent
  source rows) take output="distances", "paths" or "both", and od_matrix gains the same option.
  "both" returns a ShortestPathResult whose distances and paths come from the same searches.

path_storage="lazy" keeps compact predecessor trees instead of route lists: get_path() rebuilds one
  route without another search, and .paths materializes the whole table on first access.

od_matrix supports mode="pairwise" and cutoff (inclusive), with threshold kept as an alias.
  iter_od_matrix yields origin-row blocks to bound memory, and batch_size limits the searches in
  flight. Searches stop once every requested target settles, are shared by inputs on the same graph
  node and run from the smaller unique OD side.

The routing code moves to iduedu/graph/routing.py and routing_result.py; iduedu.graph.shortest_paths
  re-exports it, so the specialised *_path and *_path_length helpers keep their signatures and
  return types. Every helper is also an UrbanGraph method.

benchmarks/bench_routing.py compares separate and joint calculations offline. The matrices guide,
  README and the shortest-path notebook cover the new outputs.

* feat(gtfs): average boarding waits over service days and deduplicate overlapping feeds

Without service_date, boarding waits are now those of the average day: the waits of each service day
  of the feed's calendar (at most 366 days from its start) or of service_period are computed on that
  day's trips alone, then averaged with every calendar day weighing the same. Before, all trips
  shared one clock, so departures of different days interleaved into gaps no passenger saw and waits
  came out at about half of a real day's.

service_dates lists the days explicitly, for example a reference week plus the own weeks of merged
  sources of other years. Trips running on none of the days are left out; a feed without
  calendar.txt or calendar_dates.txt is taken as one day.

Scheduled waits are computed per line instead of per pattern: all patterns of a route leaving a stop
  for the same next stop share one headway, so branches, short workings and expresses no longer
  inflate the wait. The next stop, not direction_id, decides the direction.

merge_gtfs_feeds(deduplicate=True) and deduplicate_across_feeds() count overlapping sources once:
  platforms of different sources within 0.5 m are fused and trips another source already runs
  identically are dropped. Platforms of one source are never fused.

Trip-level columns repeated in stop_times.txt (route_id and direction_id, as in Kuala Lumpur's
  feeds) no longer shadow the values from trips.txt.

* feat(osm): build OSM graphs from local .osm.pbf files

config.set_osm_source("pbf", path=...) or `with config.use_pbf(path):` makes every OSM-based builder
  read a local OpenStreetMap file through the optional pyosmium dependency (pip install
  "iduedu[pbf]") instead of the Overpass API. The same queries are answered with the same filters
  and poly: rules: street ways, public-transport routes, subway stop areas and boundaries.
  IDUEDU_OSM_SOURCE and IDUEDU_PBF_PATH select the source at import time.

split_by_polygons() cuts complete per-city files out of a regional extract in one pass, and
  snapshot_time() reads the moment a file reflects. PbfSource, parse_way_filter and WayFilter are
  available for direct use; Overpass syntax beyond tag filters raises UnsupportedFilterError.

iduedu imports and works without pyosmium; only the pbf source requires it.

* docs: bring the agent and contributor guides in line with the new modules

AGENTS.md describes the routing, GTFS service-day and osm_pbf modules, the PBF data flow and the
  supported Python versions; CONTRIBUTING.md states Python 3.11 through 3.14.

## v2.1.0 (2026-09-14)

IduEdu 2.1.0 builds public transport graphs from GTFS Schedule feeds, reconstructs shortest paths as actual routes, and fixes how public transport routes are assembled from OpenStreetMap. The public transport travel-time model is recalibrated against published timetables, so travel times and waits differ from 2.0; see **Upgrading from 2.0** below.

### Highlights

- **Public transport from GTFS.** `get_gtfs_public_transport_graph` builds a static graph from a GTFS directory, a ZIP archive or several feeds at once, with waiting times taken from the timetable.
- **Routes, not only distances.** `single_source_dijkstra_path`, `multi_source_dijkstra_path` and `path_to_edges` return the nodes and edges a shortest path actually follows.
- **OSM routes without teleports.** Route relations are stitched in the right order and direction and cut at holes, instead of being bridged by straight lines across the city.
- **Recalibrated travel times.** Per-mode free-flow speed, dwell and waiting time in `TransportSpec`, fitted against published timetables.

### Upgrading from 2.0

- `TransportSpec` no longer has `traffic_coef`, and `base_speed_kmh` is required. A call such as `TransportSpec("bus", ..., traffic_coef=0.7)` now raises `TypeError`. A road speed limit still caps the speed where it is lower than the mode's own.
- `get_public_transport_graph` no longer takes `avg_boarding_time_min`. The wait is set per mode through `TransportSpec.avg_wait_time_min`. To keep the flat one-minute wait of 2.0:

```python
from dataclasses import replace

from iduedu import DEFAULT_REGISTRY, TransportRegistry, get_public_transport_graph

one_minute_wait = TransportRegistry(
    {name: replace(DEFAULT_REGISTRY.get(name), avg_wait_time_min=1.0) for name in DEFAULT_REGISTRY.list_types()}
)
graph = get_public_transport_graph(osm_id=1114252, transport_registry=one_minute_wait)
```

- Travel times change with default settings too: OSM boarding edges now cost 3-8.2 minutes depending on the mode instead of 1 minute, and in-vehicle times follow the new speed model. Rebuild matrices and accessibility results computed with 2.0.
- With `transport_types=None` the OSM builder also fetches `monorail` and share taxi (`taxi`) routes, and `tram` includes OSM `light_rail` routes. Pass `transport_types` explicitly to limit the modes.
- OSM route relations with a gap over 1 km are split into parts, and routes without stops or platforms are left out, so node and edge counts differ from 2.0.
- In intermodal graphs `subway_platform` nodes are no longer attached to the walk network directly; they are reached through stations and entrances.

### Features

#### GTFS Schedule graphs

- `get_gtfs_public_transport_graph(feed, *, service_date, start_time, end_time, crs, single_departure_wait_min, walk_speed_m_per_min)` accepts a GTFS directory, a ZIP archive, a `GTFSFeed` or a list of them.
- `service_date` applies `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`; `start_time` and `end_time` select a time window, overnight windows included.
- Trips with the same route, direction, shape and stop order form a route pattern; a segment's time is the median scheduled time.
- Boarding waits come from the timetable: half the mean gap between departures, or `headway_secs / 120` for `frequencies.txt`. A stop with a single departure gets no boarding edge unless `single_departure_wait_min` is set.
- Segment geometry is cut from `shapes.txt`; without shapes it is a straight line whose length is multiplied by `sqrt(2)`.
- `pathways.txt` becomes `pathway` edges inside stations, and `parent_station` becomes zero-cost `station_link` edges, so a metro is not dropped as a separate component.
- GTFS route types 0-7, 11 and 12 and Google's extended route types are mapped by explicit ranges (for example 200-209 -> `coach`, 405 -> `monorail`); unknown codes stay `public_transport`.
- New `iduedu.gtfs` module with `read_gtfs_feed`, `GTFSFeed`, `validate_gtfs_feed`, `GTFSValidationError` and `merge_gtfs_feeds`.
- `merge_gtfs_feeds` combines several feeds of one city (New York publishes nine) and qualifies identifiers by source, so routes, trips and stops of different feeds do not collide. `merge_stops_within` optionally fuses stops across feeds within a radius.
- A GTFS graph joins an OSM walk graph through `join_pt_walk_graph` when both use the same CRS. See the [GTFS guide](https://iduclub.github.io/IduEdu/api/gtfs.html).
- Not supported yet: `transfers.txt` and time-dependent routing.

#### Shortest path reconstruction

- `single_source_dijkstra_path(graph, source_node, target_node, *, weight, cutoff, reverse)` returns one shortest path as a list of node ids.
- `multi_source_dijkstra_path` takes node ids or GeoDataFrames of origins and destinations, `mode="all_to_all"` or `mode="pairwise"`, a `threshold` and `max_workers`, and reconstructs paths in parallel Numba kernels.
- `path_to_edges` turns a node path into an ordered GeoDataFrame of graph edges, taking the lightest of parallel edges, ready for mapping.
- All three are also available as `UrbanGraph` methods.

#### Transport modes and travel time

- `TransportSpec` gains `base_speed_kmh` (free-flow speed of the mode), `dwell_min` (time standing at a stop, added per segment) and `avg_wait_time_min` (wait on OSM boarding edges).
- On segments too short to reach full speed, the peak speed scales as `sqrt(L / span)`, so short hops no longer all take the same time.
- Default specs are fitted against GTFS timetables matched to OSM. Default waits are medians across cities of timetable waits over regular services (bus 8.2 min over 115 cities, tram 4.95, subway 3.02, train 7.71). Monorail and share taxi borrow the subway and bus profiles, because no calibration city publishes a timetable for them.

| Mode | Base speed, km/h | Wait, min | Dwell, min |
|---|---|---|---|
| bus | 41.0 | 8.2 | 0.475 |
| trolleybus | 20.0 | 5.92 | 0.325 |
| tram | 41.5 | 4.95 | 1.2 |
| subway | 49.0 | 3.02 | 0.35 |
| monorail | 49.0 | 3.0 | 0.35 |
| taxi (share taxi) | 41.0 | 8.0 | 0.475 |
| train (`DEFAULT_REGISTRY_W_TRAIN`) | 50.5 | 7.71 | 0.375 |

- `OSM_ROUTE_ALIASES` in `iduedu.constants.transport_specs` maps OSM route tags to registry modes: `light_rail` -> `tram`, `share_taxi` -> `taxi`, while `monorail` keeps its own mode.
- Every mode except the subway is parsed from OSM the same way, so any mode in the registry reaches the graph.

### Bug fixes

#### OSM public transport routes

- Route pieces are ordered by cheapest insertion with local search. The old chain growing from both ends could glue a mid-route detour onto the far end and draw a straight line across the city (14.4 km in Delhi); this dated back to v1.1.0.
- A route is cut into parts at gaps over 1 km instead of bridging a hole in the relation with a straight line.
- Direction follows the stop order when at least three stops near the path agree by a clear majority, otherwise the ways. A first way drawn backwards no longer reverses the whole route. Share of one-way streets driven the legal way: Delhi 91.2% -> 97.5%, Saint Petersburg 84.1% -> 99.8%, Moscow 80.3% -> 99.3%.
- Speeds stay aligned with segments when pieces are reversed or joined.
- Across the 124 study cities with a public transport graph all graphs build, road edges with a straight segment over 1.5 km fall from 1,866 to 558 (the rest is OSM way geometry), and 1,037 routes lose their teleports.
- Subway routes parse in territories without stop area data.
- Route relations with no members, or with members lacking a ref, no longer abort the city's graph.

#### Graph editing and intermodal graphs

- An object that coincides with the graph is mapped onto the existing node instead of getting an isolated node with a zero-length connector, and connector edges are returned when every object snaps to an existing node.
- Equally distant nearest edges are resolved deterministically (an endpoint wins, then the lower node id) instead of raising `ValueError`.
- Intermodal graphs are composed with `join_urban_graphs`, and edge keys `(u, v, k)` stay unique across walk and public transport edges.
- Platforms out of reach of the walk network are logged, and a warning names the public transport node types dropped by the largest-component filter.
- `write_urban_graph` writes tables whose object columns mix numbers and strings, as OSM tags often do, instead of failing with `ArrowInvalid`.

### Documentation

- New [GTFS guide](https://iduclub.github.io/IduEdu/api/gtfs.html) and API reference for shortest path reconstruction; the shortest path notebook maps intermodal routes by transport type.
- README, high-level API and transport registry pages describe GTFS graphs and the new speed model.
- Documentation is published at https://iduclub.github.io/IduEdu/.

### Project

- The repository moved to [IDUclub/IduEdu](https://github.com/IDUclub/IduEdu); old GitHub links redirect.
- Releases run only in the official repository after Tests and Coverage pass on `main`, and the documentation is rebuilt after each release.
- Coverage is reported in pull request comments with an in-repo badge instead of Codecov.
- Added `CITATION.cff`.
- `paper2026/` holds the reproducibility pipeline, benchmarks and figures of the accompanying paper; it is not shipped in the wheel or sdist.
- No new runtime dependencies; Python 3.11-3.12 as before.
