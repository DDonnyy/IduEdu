"""Waiting times per mode, read off the reference graphs.

The number is taken from the ``boarding`` edges of each city's GTFS graph rather
than recomputed from headways here. That is deliberate: the wait a rider
experiences in this study's accessibility model *is* the boarding edge weight, so
measuring anything else would report a quantity the results do not use.

Aggregation is harmonic within a city and median across cities. Harmonic because
averaging waits directly is averaging the wrong thing -- what adds across a
network is service frequency, and the harmonic mean of waits is the reciprocal of
the mean frequency. A city with one bus an hour and one every two minutes runs a
two-minute service for almost everyone using it.

Pattern-stops with a single scheduled departure carry the fallback constant, not
a measured headway, and are excluded from the headline figure.

⚠ ``single_departure_share`` is **not** the share of stops served once a day, and
must not be reported as one. A pattern-stop has one departure when any of three
different things is true, and the feeds in this sample show all three:

* service really is that rare;
* every trip carries its own stop sequence, so each trip is its own pattern --
  Blue Downs has 236 trips and 236 distinct sequences, Kumasi 343 and 326;
* one timetable is repeated across several ``service_id`` values with identical
  clock times, which deduplication collapses to a single departure -- Bar has 22
  trips over 4 sequences and Vijayawada 433 over 46, yet both come out at 1.00.

Separating them needs the feed, not the graph. Until that is done the column is a
diagnostic for excluding rows from the wait statistic, nothing more.
