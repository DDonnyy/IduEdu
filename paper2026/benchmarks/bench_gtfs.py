B7 — Transit-layer construction from a GTFS feed: IduEdu vs peartree.

B2 measures what it costs to build the transit layer from OSM route relations.
This stage measures the same thing from the other open source -- a published
timetable -- so the two can be put side by side.

The two tools are not interchangeable and the table should not pretend they are.
IduEdu returns an ``UrbanGraph`` with separate boarding, alighting, travel and
station-link edges, carrying geometry and ready to be joined to a pedestrian
network. peartree returns a NetworkX ``MultiDiGraph`` of stops and headway-derived
costs, with no walk layer to join to; its ``join`` column is therefore empty by
construction, not by omission.

Service selection is made comparable rather than left to each tool's default:
both arms are given the same departure window (``--window``), because IduEdu
defaults to every trip in the feed and peartree requires a window.

Feeds come from ``bench_feeds/`` -- copies, kept apart from the study corpus in
``city_feeds/`` so that rerunning a sweep cannot change what a benchmark measured.
Cities whose feed is absent are reported with a reason and skipped; Seoul has no
GTFS feed in either public catalogue at all and is not expected here.

One CSV row per (area, library, attempt); resume-safe.

Usage:
    python bench_gtfs.py
    python bench_gtfs.py --smoke
    python bench_gtfs.py --areas "London,Moscow" --window 07:00-09:00
    python bench_gtfs.py --no-join            # transit layer only, skip the walk join
