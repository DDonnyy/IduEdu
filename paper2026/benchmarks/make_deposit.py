"""Assemble everything the archive needs, so depositing is an upload and not a decision.

What goes in and what stays out is settled here rather than at upload time.

**Derived tables go in.** Every number in the paper comes from
``results/wide_tier/*.csv``, and those are our own measurements of third-party
data, not the data itself.

**Published feeds stay out.** Some of the archives carry licences that forbid
redistribution -- Santiago and Saint Petersburg among them -- and auditing 169
licences one by one to republish the rest would put the legal burden on the
deposit for very little gain. Instead the deposit carries the identifier, the
catalogue and the source URL of every feed used, so the collection can be
rebuilt from its sources.

**Code goes in**, because a table nobody can regenerate is not a result.

The output is a directory ready to upload, with a manifest of checksums.

README = """# Open transit schedules against OpenStreetMap: measurements for {n_cities} cities

This deposit accompanies the paper *How complete is OpenStreetMap for public
transport?* It holds the measurements the paper reports, the code that produced
them, and enough provenance to rebuild the inputs.

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `results/METRICS.md` | every headline number in the paper, generated from the tables beside it |
| `results/*.csv` | the measurements themselves, one row per city or per city and mode |
| `results/feed_sources.csv` | identifier, catalogue, licence and URL of every schedule used |
| `code/benchmarks/` | the pipeline, one module per stage |
| `code/figures/` | the figure generator and the nine images the paper shows |
| `environment/` | dependency specifications |
| `MANIFEST.sha256` | checksum of every file above |

## What is deliberately not here

The published schedule archives themselves. Some carry licences that forbid
redistribution, and rather than republish some and not others we list the source
of every one in `results/feed_sources.csv`. Catalogues overwrite feeds in place
without versioning, so a rebuild from those URLs will not reproduce this study
exactly; that limitation is stated in the paper.

OpenStreetMap extracts are likewise not included. They are large, they change
daily, and the pipeline fetches them from the Overpass API on demand.

## Reproducing

Create the environment from `environment/environment-bench.yml`, then run the
stages in the order they appear in `code/benchmarks/README.md`. A full sweep over
the cohort costs about five and a half hours of computation once the
OpenStreetMap extracts are cached locally.

The graph library is IduEdu, an open-source Python package; the constants that
produced these results are identified in the paper by the digest
`{fingerprint}`.

## Citing

Cite the paper for the findings and this deposit for the measurements:
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22232337>.

## Licence

Everything we made -- the measurements in `results/`, the pipeline in `code/`
and the figures -- is **CC BY 4.0**.

Two things inside are not ours to license, and neither restricts reuse of the
measurements. `code/figures/data/city_boundaries/` holds one administrative
boundary taken straight from OpenStreetMap; unlike the tables, that is not an
analysis result but a copy of the source geometry, so it stays under **ODbL
1.0**, attribution to OpenStreetMap contributors. The basemap beside it is
Natural Earth and is in the public domain.

The tables themselves are counts, medians and correlations computed from
OpenStreetMap and from published schedules. They are analysis output rather than
extracted data, so they are ours to license -- with attribution to OpenStreetMap
contributors, whose data they were computed from. The schedules remain under
their publishers' own licences, listed per feed in `results/feed_sources.csv`.

Assembled {today}.
